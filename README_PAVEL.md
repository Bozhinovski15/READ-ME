Student at the Militray Academy "Mihailo Apostolski", Skopje
--------------------------

Born in a small town with big dreams, I traded my childhood bicycle for combat boots. Enlisting straight out of high school, I marched into the military world with determination. Amid deployments and drills, I discovered my passion for connecting beyond the battlefield. Juggling active service and late-night study sessions at the prestigious Military Academy, I learned to decode both signals and strategies. Now, armed with a headset and a rifle, I navigate the complex terrain of technology and warfare, always on call for duty and connectivity. -->
